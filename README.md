An example of a .net core console application using Automapper, as well as how to create tests for automapper profiles.

There are unit tests for Automapper, the Automapper Asset profile as well as unit tests for the extension methods which are an alternative to using Automapper.

There is also a benchmark test project which is utilising [benchmarkdotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet). You can view the results [here](AutomapperBenchmarking/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/Mappings-report-github.md).
